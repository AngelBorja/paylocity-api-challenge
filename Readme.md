# Paylocity API Tests
This repo contains a Postman collection for testing the Paylocity Benefits API, including automated assertions, variable chaining, and cleanup validation.

### How to Run Locally
#### Option A: Use npx (Recommended — No Global Install Needed)
'''bash
npx newman run "Paylocity tests.postman_collection.json" --reporters cli,html --reporter-html-export "results.html"
'''

This works even if you haven’t installed Newman globally. It uses the local version from node_modules.


##### Option B: Install Globally (Optional)
'''bash
npm install -g newman newman-reporter-html
newman run "Paylocity tests.postman_collection.json" --reporters cli,html --reporter-html-export "results.html"
'''

### Test Flow

- Update Employee – modifies user and updates variables
- Get by ID – validates updated data
- Delete Employee – removes user
- Verify Deletion – confirms user no longer exists
